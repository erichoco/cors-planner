It continues the introduction that begins in CS1010, and emphasises objectoriented programming with application to simple data structures. Topics include object-oriented problem modeling with objects, classes and methods, object-oriented problem formulation and solving, data structure implementation strageties, abstraction and encapsulation of data structures, object-oriented programming constructs, APIs and class libraries, exception handling, lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and their algorithmic design, sorting and searching methods, recursive algorithms, and Big-O notation. This module is appropriate for SoC and FoS students.","examinable":"-","examDate":"04-12-2012 EVENING","credits":4,"prerequisite":"CS1010 Programming Methodology","preclusion":"CG1102, CG1103, CS1020E, CS1102, CS1102C, CS1102S, CS2020","workload":"2-1-1-3-3","lectures":{"WEDNESDAY-1000-1200":[{"classNo":"1","type":"SECTIONAL TEACHING","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"WEDNESDAY","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","room":"LT19"}]},"tutorials":{"TUESDAY-900-1000":[{"classNo":"1","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"TUESDAY","startTime":"900","endTime":"1000","room":"COM1-0207"}],"TUESDAY-1000-1100":[{"classNo":"2","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"TUESDAY","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","room":"COM1-0207"}],"TUESDAY-1100-1200":[{"classNo":"3","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"TUESDAY","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","room":"COM1-0207"}],"THURSDAY-1400-1500":[{"classNo":"4","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1500","room":"COM1-0207"}],"THURSDAY-1500-1600":[{"classNo":"5","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1600","room":"COM1-0207"}],"THURSDAY-1600-1700":[{"classNo":"6","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1700","room":"COM1-0207"}],"THURSDAY-1000-1100":[{"classNo":"7","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1100","room":"COM1-0207"}],"THURSDAY-1100-1200":[{"classNo":"8","type":"TUTORIAL","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1100","endTime":"1200","room":"COM1-0207"}]},"labs":{"THURSDAY-1000-1200":[{"classNo":"1","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","room":"COM1-B112"},{"classNo":"5","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","room":"COM1-0120"}],"THURSDAY-1200-1400":[{"classNo":"2","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","room":"COM1-B112"},{"classNo":"6","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","room":"COM1-0120"}],"THURSDAY-1400-1600":[{"classNo":"3","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","room":"COM1-B112"},{"classNo":"7","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","room":"COM1-0120"}],"THURSDAY-1600-1800":[{"classNo":"4","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","room":"COM1-B112"},{"classNo":"8","type":"LABORATORY","weekType":"EVERY WEEK","weekDay":"THURSDAY","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","room":"COM1-0120"}]}}
